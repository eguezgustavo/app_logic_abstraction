# Application logic abstraction
This is a simple task-list application. There are three entry points: a flask application, a cli application, and a console application. The main idea of this repository is to illustrate the abstraction of the application logic from the implementation.

To run the flask app execute:
```
python flask_app.py
```

To run the cli app execute:
```
python cli_app.py
```

or 

```
python cli_app.py --pending
```

To run the console app execute:
```
python console_app.py
```
