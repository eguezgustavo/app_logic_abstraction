# Application logic abstraction
This is a simple task list application. There are two entry points, a flask application and a cli application. The main idea of this respository is to ilustrate how application logic should be abstracted of the implementation.

To run the flask app execute:
```
python flask_app.py
```

To run the cli app execute:
```
python cli_app.py
```

or 

```
python cli_app.py --pending
```
